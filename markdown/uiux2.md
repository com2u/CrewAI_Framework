# Suggestion for Improving Design, Layout, or Usability of Frontend

## Introduce a Responsive Design and Mobile-First Approach

The current design focuses on desktop views, but with the increasing number of mobile users, it's essential to adopt a responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes and devices. This can be achieved by applying a mobile-first approach, where the layout is designed for smaller screens first and then scaled up for larger ones.

### Benefits

* Improved user experience across different devices
* Increased accessibility for users with smaller screens or disabilities
* Better search engine optimization (SEO) due to more efficient rendering of content

### Implementation

1. Use a CSS framework like Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, or Material-UI that provides pre-designed responsive layouts.
2. Use media queries to adjust the layout based on screen size and orientation.
3. Prioritize essential elements and reduce clutter for smaller screens.
4. Ensure all interactive elements are easily accessible and usable.

Example:

```css
/* Mobile-first approach */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  /* Adjust layout for larger screens */
}
```

By adopting a responsive design and mobile-first approach, the frontend will provide a better user experience across various devices, improve accessibility, and enhance search engine optimization.
