One important suggestion to improve the code is to enhance error handling, especially when dealing with localStorage operations. Currently, the code assumes that localStorage operations will always succeed, which might not be the case. For instance, localStorage might be full, or the user might be in private browsing mode where localStorage is disabled. Adding error handling will make the code more robust and professional.

Here's how you can improve the error handling for localStorage operations:

1. **Wrap localStorage operations in try-catch blocks**: This will ensure that any errors during these operations are caught and handled gracefully.

2. **Provide user feedback**: Inform the user if there is an issue with saving or retrieving data from localStorage.

Here's an example of how you can implement these improvements:

```javascript
document.getElementById('deviceForm').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
    event.preventDefault();

    // Get form values
    const deviceName = document.getElementById('deviceName').value;
    const deviceType = document.getElementById('deviceType').value;
    const ownerName = document.getElementById('ownerName').value;
    const batteryStatus = parseInt(document.getElementById('batteryStatus').value);

    // Create a new device object
    const device = {
        id: Date.now(),
        deviceName,
        deviceType,
        ownerName,
        batteryStatus
    };

    // Add device to the list
    devices.push(device);

    try {
        localStorage.setItem('devices', JSON.stringify(devices));
        addDeviceToTable(device);
        // Clear form
        document.getElementById('deviceForm').reset();
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error saving to localStorage', error);
        alert('Failed to save device. Please try again.');
    }
});

function deleteDevice(deviceId) {
    // Remove the device from the list and table
    devices = devices.filter(d => d.id !== deviceId);

    try {
        localStorage.setItem('devices', JSON.stringify(devices));
        const row = document.querySelector(`tr[data-id='${deviceId}']`);
        row.parentNode.removeChild(row);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error saving to localStorage', error);
        alert('Failed to delete device. Please try again.');
    }
}
```

By implementing these changes, you ensure that the application handles potential errors gracefully, providing a better user experience and making the code more stable and professional.
