### Code Quality and Style 

- Consider using a linter like ESLint to enforce a consistent style across the project. This will help avoid inconsistencies and make the code easier to read for you and your team members.

### Architecture 

- It's better to separate the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into different files for better organization and maintainability.

### Naming 

- Use meaningful variable and function names. For example, `devices` is a good name, but `deviceForm` or `deviceContainer` would be more descriptive than `device-form` or `device-container`.

### Error Handling 

- Add error handling for user input validation, network requests, and other potential error sources.

### Functionality 

- The current code implementation does not decrease the battery status every second. To achieve this, you can use `setInterval` to decrease the battery status of each device.

Here's an example of how you can implement this:

```javascript
function decreaseBatteryStatus() {
  devices.forEach((device) => {
    if (device.batteryStatus > 0) {
      device.batteryStatus--;
    }
  });
  renderDevices();
}

setInterval(decreaseBatteryStatus, 1000);
```

- The current code implementation does not persist the device data. To achieve this, you can use a client-side storage mechanism like localStorage or IndexedDB.

Here's an example of how you can implement this using localStorage:

```javascript
const STORAGE_KEY = "devices";

function saveDevices() {
  localStorage.setItem(STORAGE_KEY, JSON.stringify(devices));
}

function loadDevices() {
  const savedDevices = localStorage.getItem(STORAGE_KEY);
  if (savedDevices) {
    devices.push(...JSON.parse(savedDevices));
  }
}

loadDevices();

// Call saveDevices() whenever devices is updated
saveDevices();
```

These suggestions will help make the code more stable, robust, and professional. Make sure to follow these guidelines in your future projects.
