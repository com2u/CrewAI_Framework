# Code Review Suggestion

**Suggestion: Implement Error Handling for Asynchronous Operations**

Currently, the `decreaseBatteryStatus` function includes an asynchronous operation using `setTimeout` but lacks proper error handling. Introducing error handling for such operations ensures that the application remains robust and stable, even in cases where unexpected errors occur.

### Implementation

1. **Enhance `decreaseBatteryStatus` Function:**
   - Wrap the `setTimeout` logic in a `try-catch` block to handle potential errors during the battery status update.
   - Log any errors to the console to assist in debugging and monitoring.

2. **Example Code:**

```javascript
function decreaseBatteryStatus(index) {
    try {
        if (devices[index] && devices[index].batteryStatus > 0) {
            setTimeout(() => {
                devices[index].batteryStatus -= 1;
                document.getElementById(`batteryStatus${index}`).innerText = `${devices[index].batteryStatus}%`;
                decreaseBatteryStatus(index);
            }, 1000);
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Error decreasing battery status for device at index ${index}:`, error);
    }
}
```

### Benefits

- **Robustness:** Ensures that even if an error occurs, it won't bring down the application or leave it in an inconsistent state.
- **Debugging:** Improved error logging aids in quick identification and resolution of issues.
- **User Experience:** Maintains a seamless user experience by preventing unexpected application crashes.

By adding proper error handling, especially for asynchronous operations, you enhance the stability and professional quality of your code.
