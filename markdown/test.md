## Introduction
---------------

The Error Handling System is a JavaScript library that provides a simple way to handle errors in your application.

### Features Check

*   **Log errors with detailed information** : 
    *   [x] Implementation found: `errorHandler.logError(error)` function
*   **Display error messages to the user** :
    *   [x] Implementation found: `errorHandler.displayError()` function
*   **Support for catching and handling errors in try-catch blocks** :
    *   [x] Implementation found: `try`-`catch` block usage

## Using the Error Handler
---------------------------

To use the error handler, simply include the JavaScript file in your HTML document.

### Creating an Instance of the Error Handler Check

*   **Creating a new instance of the error handler** :
    *   [x] Implementation found: `const errorHandler = new ErrorHandlingSystem();`

## Adding Devices
-----------------

To add devices to your database, you can use the `addDevice` function.

### Example Usage Check

*   **Adding a device using the `addDevice` function** :
    *   [x] Implementation found: `db.addDevice({id: 1, name: "Device 1", description: "This is device 1"})`
*   **Error handling during device addition** :
    *   [x] Implementation found: `try`-`catch` block usage and error logging using `errorHandler.logError(error)`

## Error Handling
-----------------

The error handler provides a simple way to catch and handle errors in your application.

### Example Usage Check

*   **Using the error handler to log and display errors** :
    *   [x] Implementation found: `errorHandler.logError(error)` function and `try`-`catch` block usage

## Adding a Device Form
-------------------------

The following form can be used to add devices.

### Notes Check

*   **Form submission and device addition functionality** :
    *   [ ] Missing implementation: The `addDevice` function should be called when the form is submitted.
*   **Error handling during form submission** :
    *   [ ] Missing implementation: The error handler can be used to log and display errors that occur during form submission.

Test Results:
-------------

The Error Handling System has been tested against the provided documentation. All features and functionalities have been checked, and the results are as follows:

*   The `logError` function has been implemented.
*   The `displayError` function has been implemented.
*   Try-catch block usage has been implemented for error handling.
*   Creating a new instance of the error handler using the `new ErrorHandlingSystem()` function has been implemented.

However, there are some missing implementations:

*   The `addDevice` function is called when the form is submitted.
*   Error handling during form submission is not implemented.
