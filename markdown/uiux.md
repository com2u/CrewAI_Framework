**Improving Design Suggestion**
=========================

### **Use a more robust and consistent error handling approach**

In the given code, the error handling is implemented using `try`-`catch` blocks. While this works for simple cases, it's not the most efficient or scalable way to handle errors in a real-world application.

A better approach would be to use a dedicated error handling system, such as a library like [Error Handling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Error_handling#Error_Handling_Systems). This would allow for more advanced features like error propagation, centralized logging, and customizable error display.

**Benefits**

* Improved code organization and maintainability
* Better handling of complex errors with multiple causes
* Enhanced user experience through customizable error messages and behavior

**Implementation Example**
```html
// Create a dedicated error handler instance
const errorHandler = new ErrorHandlingSystem();

try {
    // Simulating a database operation
    db.addDevice({
        id: 1,
        name: "Device 1",
        description: "This is device 1"
    });
} catch (error) {
    // Use the error handler to log and display the error
    errorHandler.logError(error);
    document.getElementById("database-error").innerHTML = "An error occurred while adding a device.";
}

// ...
```

Note that this is just one possible suggestion, and there are many other ways to improve the design of the given code. However, using a dedicated error handling system would provide significant benefits in terms of code organization, maintainability, and user experience.
