**Suggestion: Add A Loading Indicator**

The current design does not provide any visual feedback when loading data from the database or processing user input. To improve usability and provide a better user experience, I suggest adding a loading indicator to indicate that the application is working on something.

This can be achieved by displaying a spinning animation (e.g., a circle or a line) while the data is being loaded or processed. This will give users an idea of what's happening behind the scenes and prevent them from wondering if the application has frozen.

Here's how it could be implemented:

```html
<div id="loading-indicator" style="display: none;">
    <img src="spinner.gif" alt="Loading...">
</div>
```

And then, in the JavaScript code:

```javascript
function updateDeviceTable() {
    // ...
    document.getElementById('loading-indicator').style.display = 'block';
    
    db.all("SELECT * FROM devices", function(err, rows) {
        if (err) {
            console.error(err);
        } else {
            // ...
            document.getElementById('loading-indicator').style.display = 'none';
        }
    });
}
```

This will display the loading indicator when calling `updateDeviceTable()` and hide it once the data has been loaded. This is a simple yet effective way to improve the user experience and provide feedback on the application's progress.

You can customize the loading indicator to fit your design and preferences, but this should give you an idea of how to implement it.
