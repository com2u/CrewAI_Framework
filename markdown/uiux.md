To improve the design, layout, and usability of the frontend, I suggest implementing a responsive design using CSS Grid or Flexbox. This will enhance the user experience across various device sizes and improve the overall layout. Here's how we can implement this suggestion:

# Implementing Responsive Design with CSS Grid

To make the Device Management App more user-friendly and accessible across different devices, we can implement a responsive design using CSS Grid. This will improve the layout and usability of the app, especially on mobile devices. Here's how we can modify the existing CSS:

1. Add a container for the main content:

```html
<div class="container">
    <!-- Wrap all content inside this container -->
</div>
```

2. Update the CSS to use Grid layout:

```css
.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    gap: 20px;
    max-width: 1200px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding: 20px;
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
    .container {
        grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
    }
}

@media (min-width: 1024px) {
    .container {
        grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
    }
}

.form-container {
    grid-column: 1 / -1;
}

#deviceTable {
    grid-column: 1 / -1;
}
```

3. Adjust the table layout for better responsiveness:

```css
@media (max-width: 767px) {
    table, thead, tbody, th, td, tr {
        display: block;
    }

    thead tr {
        position: absolute;
        top: -9999px;
        left: -9999px;
    }

    tr {
        margin-bottom: 15px;
    }

    td {
        border: none;
        position: relative;
        padding-left: 50%;
    }

    td:before {
        position: absolute;
        top: 6px;
        left: 6px;
        width: 45%;
        padding-right: 10px;
        white-space: nowrap;
        content: attr(data-label);
        font-weight: bold;
    }
}
```

4. Update the table structure in HTML to include data labels:

```html
<table id="deviceTable">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Device Name</th>
            <th>Device Type</th>
            <th>Owner Name</th>
            <th>Battery Status</th>
            <th>Actions</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <!-- Example row -->
        <tr>
            <td data-label="Device Name">iPhone 12</td>
            <td data-label="Device Type">ðŸ“± Smartphone</td>
            <td data-label="Owner Name">John Doe</td>
            <td data-label="Battery Status">
                <div class="battery-status">
                    <div class="battery-level" style="width: 75%; background-color: green"></div>
                </div>
                75%
            </td>
            <td data-label="Actions">
                <button class="update-btn">Update</button>
                <button class="delete-btn">Delete</button>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
```

These changes will make the Device Management App responsive and more user-friendly on various screen sizes. The form and table will stack vertically on smaller screens, and the table will adapt to a card-like layout for better readability on mobile devices. On larger screens, the form and table will be displayed side by side, making efficient use of the available space.
```

This suggestion focuses on improving the layout and usability of the frontend by implementing a responsive design. It addresses the need for better adaptability across different device sizes, which is crucial for a modern web application. The use of CSS Grid allows for a flexible and efficient layout structure, while the responsive table design ensures that the content remains readable and accessible on smaller screens.
