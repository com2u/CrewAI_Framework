To improve the design, layout, and usability of the frontend, I suggest implementing a responsive grid layout for the device management interface. This enhancement will significantly improve the user experience, especially on different screen sizes and devices. Here's how we can implement this change:

# Implementing a Responsive Grid Layout

1. Replace the current table-based layout with a grid layout for displaying devices.

2. Update the HTML structure:
   ```html
   <div id="deviceGrid" class="device-grid">
     <!-- Device cards will be dynamically inserted here -->
   </div>
   ```

3. Add the following CSS to create a responsive grid:
   ```css
   .device-grid {
     display: grid;
     grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr));
     gap: 20px;
     padding: 20px;
   }

   .device-card {
     background-color: #f9f9f9;
     border-radius: 8px;
     padding: 15px;
     box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
     transition: transform 0.3s ease;
   }

   .device-card:hover {
     transform: translateY(-5px);
   }

   .device-card h3 {
     margin-top: 0;
     display: flex;
     align-items: center;
   }

   .device-card .device-icon {
     margin-right: 10px;
   }

   .device-card .battery-status {
     margin-top: 10px;
   }

   .device-card .action-buttons {
     margin-top: 15px;
   }

   @media (max-width: 600px) {
     .device-grid {
       grid-template-columns: 1fr;
     }
   }
   ```

4. Update the `renderDeviceTable` function to use the new grid layout:
   ```javascript
   function renderDeviceGrid() {
     const deviceGrid = document.getElementById('deviceGrid');
     deviceGrid.innerHTML = '';

     devices.forEach((device, index) => {
       const card = document.createElement('div');
       card.className = 'device-card';
       card.innerHTML = `
         <h3><span class="device-icon">${getDeviceIcon(device.type)}</span>${sanitizeInput(device.name)}</h3>
         <p><strong>Type:</strong> ${sanitizeInput(device.type)}</p>
         <p><strong>Owner:</strong> ${sanitizeInput(device.owner)}</p>
         <div class="battery-status">
           <strong>Battery:</strong> ${device.battery}%
           <div class="battery-level ${device.battery > 0 ? 'battery-full' : 'battery-empty'}" style="width: ${device.battery}%;"></div>
         </div>
         <div class="action-buttons">
           <button onclick="showUpdateForm(${index})">Update</button>
           <button onclick="deleteDevice(${index})">Delete</button>
         </div>
       `;
       deviceGrid.appendChild(card);
     });

     updateBatteryChart();
   }
   ```

5. Update all references to `renderDeviceTable` to `renderDeviceGrid` throughout the JavaScript code.

This change will create a more modern, responsive layout that adapts well to different screen sizes. Each device will be displayed as a card in a grid, making it easier for users to scan and interact with the devices. The hover effect on cards adds a nice touch of interactivity, and the consistent layout of information within each card improves readability and usability.
```

This suggestion provides a significant improvement to the design and usability of the frontend. It transforms the current table-based layout into a modern, responsive grid layout that works well across various devices and screen sizes. The card-based design for each device makes the information more visually appealing and easier to digest, while the responsive nature of the grid ensures a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
