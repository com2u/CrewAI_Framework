To improve the design and user experience of the frontend, I suggest adding visual feedback to indicate that the battery status is being updated. This can be achieved by using a progress bar or an animated icon next to each device. This way, users can easily see that the battery status is being updated and have a better understanding of the current status. You can implement this by adding a `div` element for the progress bar and updating its width based on the current battery status.
