# Device Management App

## Overview

The Device Management App is a web-based application designed to help users manage their electronic devices. Users can add, edit, and delete devices, as well as monitor their battery status in real-time. The app stores device information in the browser's local storage, ensuring data persistence across sessions.

## Features

- **Add Device**: Users can add new devices by filling out a form with the device's name, type, owner name, and battery status.
- **Edit Device**: Users can edit the details of an existing device.
- **Delete Device**: Users can delete a device from the list.
- **Battery Monitoring**: The app displays a progress bar for each device's battery status, which drains over time to simulate real battery usage.
- **Sorting**: Users can sort the device list by device name, type, owner name, or battery status.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the HTML file.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

### Usage

1. **Add a Device**:
    - Fill out the form at the bottom of the page with the device's name, type, owner name, and battery status.
    - Click the "Add Device" button to add the device to the list.

2. **Edit a Device**:
    - Click the "Edit" button next to the device you want to edit.
    - The device's details will populate the form fields.
    - Make the necessary changes and click the "Add Device" button to save the updates.

3. **Delete a Device**:
    - Click the "Delete" button next to the device you want to remove.

4. **Monitor Battery Status**:
    - Each device's battery status is displayed as a progress bar.
    - The battery status will decrease over time, simulating real battery usage.

5. **Sort Devices**:
    - Click on the column headers (Device Name, Device Type, Owner Name, Battery Status) to sort the devices accordingly.

### Code Structure

- **HTML**: The structure of the app, including the form and table for device management.
- **CSS**: Styling for the app, including the layout, form, table, and progress bars.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality for adding, editing, deleting devices, and battery status simulation.

### Important Functions

- **addDeviceToTable(device)**: Adds a new device to the table.
- **getDeviceIcon(deviceType)**: Returns an icon based on the device type.
- **editDevice(deviceId)**: Populates the form with the device's details for editing.
- **deleteDevice(deviceId)**: Removes the device from the list and local storage.
- **drainBattery(deviceId, progressBarInner)**: Simulates battery drain over time.
- **sortTable(columnIndex)**: Sorts the table based on the specified column index.

### Local Storage

The app uses the browser's local storage to save device information. This ensures that the data persists even after the browser is closed and reopened.

### Battery Status Simulation

The battery status of each device decreases by 1% every second. When the battery status reaches 0%, the progress bar turns red to indicate a low battery.

### Icons

The app uses emojis to represent different device types:
- Smartphone: ðŸ“±
- Tablet: ðŸ“±
- Camera: ðŸ“·
- Laptop: ðŸ’»
- Car: ðŸš—
- Powerbank: ðŸ”‹
