# Device Battery Status

This documentation provides information about the software that displays the battery level of connected devices in your browser. It includes functionality to update the battery information in real-time if the devices are moved and the browser can detect that movement.

Required tools and technologies:
- Modern web browser with support for the `deviceorientation` event, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge.

## Features
- Real-time battery level updates for connected devices.
- Display of the battery level as a percentage.
- Automatic detection of connected devices.

## Usage
1. Open the HTML file in a supported web browser.
2. Move the connected devices to update the battery levels.

## Frontend Components
The frontend consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components:

- **HTML**: Defines the structure and content of the webpage, including the title, headings, and device battery information.
- **CSS**: Defines the styles and layout of the webpage, including font sizes, colors, and positioning of elements.
- **JavaScript**: Defines the functionality and behavior of the webpage, including the event listener for the `deviceorientation` event and the code to update the battery levels.

## Troubleshooting
If the battery levels are not updating in real-time, ensure that the web browser has support for the `deviceorientation` event. Additionally, check that the connected devices are moving and that the browser can detect that movement.
