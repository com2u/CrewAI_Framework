Create a web page for a device management app. The page should maintain different devices in a web page. 
             The device management app should maintain the following data per device:
             ·        Device Name (String)
             ·        DeviceType (Allowed types: Smartphone, Tablet, Camera)
             ·        Owner Name (String)
             ·        Battery Status (0…100%)
             List existing devices of the app in a table.
             Add the possibility to create new devices with a screen to input the data.
             Your solution should be one HTML page with all components, styles and JavaScript code in this file.
