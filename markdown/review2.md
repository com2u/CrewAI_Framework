**Suggestion to Improve the Code**

While the code is well-structured and follows good practices, there's one aspect that could be improved for better maintainability and scalability: **separation of concerns**. The JavaScript code is responsible for both rendering the table (using `innerHTML`) and updating the devices array. This tight coupling makes it harder to modify or extend either the rendering logic or the business logic separately.

To address this, consider introducing a **service layer** that encapsulates the device data management, such as:

```javascript
class DeviceService {
  constructor(devices) {
    this.devices = devices;
  }

  updateDevice(index, updates) {
    // Update device data in the devices array
  }

  addDevice(device) {
    // Add a new device to the devices array
  }
}
```

In your main JavaScript code, you can then use this service layer to interact with the devices array:

```javascript
const deviceService = new DeviceService(devices);

function updateTable() {
  const filteredDevices = deviceService.getFilteredDevices();
  // Re-render the table with the filtered results
}

function updateDevice(index) {
  deviceService.updateDevice(index, updates);
}
```

By separating the concerns into a service layer, you'll make your code more modular, easier to maintain, and more scalable for future extensions.

Remember to keep your code organized and follow good coding practices to ensure it remains readable and maintainable.
